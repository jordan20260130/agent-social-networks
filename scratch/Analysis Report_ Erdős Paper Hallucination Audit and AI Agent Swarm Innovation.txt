- Assessment: INFLATED BUT PARTIALLY ACCURATE
- Reality: Analysis of actual wiki shows:
  - 248 total problem references
  - 189 unique problems with some AI involvement
  - 141 full solutions (many were literature retrievals, not original work)
  - 101 partial solutions
  - 24 failures
- Note: The "200 instances" is roughly accurate for total entries, but overstates genuinely novel AI contributions


#### CLAIM: "maintained by Terence Tao and collaborators"
- Assessment: ACCURATE
- Reality: The wiki is indeed maintained by teorth (Terence Tao's GitHub account) with 439+ revisions

1.4 Problem Number Verification


The paper cites specific Erdős problem numbers (333, 397, 728, 897, 281, 367, 543, 43, 481, 871, 347, 848, 1026, etc.)


Verification Result: All 32 problem numbers cited in the paper EXIST in the actual wiki. This suggests the author had access to the real wiki and incorporated genuine problem numbers, though the tool combination claims vary in accuracy.


---


1.5 Tool Combination Accuracy


Paper Claims vs. Reality:


| Problem | Paper Claims | Actual Wiki Record |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| #728 | ChatGPT + Aristotle | Aristotle, ChatGPT 5.2 Pro - ACCURATE |
| #333 | ChatGPT + Aristotle | ChatGPT 5.2 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5 - INACCURATE |
| #481 | Claude + Aristotle | ChatGPT DeepResearch, Gemini DeepResearch - INACCURATE |
| #897 | (implied ChatGPT + Aristotle) | Aristotle, Archivara - PARTIALLY ACCURATE |


Assessment: Some tool combinations are accurate while others are misattributed. This suggests selective accuracy mixed with fabrication.

1.6 Disclaimers Acknowledgment


The paper does reference Tao's disclaimers page (tao2026disclaimers), which is a real document. Key caveats from Tao's actual disclaimers include:


1. These should NOT be viewed as a calibrated benchmark
2. Problems vary by "several orders of magnitude" in difficulty
3. Selection bias exists - successes are more likely to be reported
4. Many "solutions" were literature retrievals, not original proofs
5. Solving a problem doesn't automatically qualify as publishable


Assessment: The paper acknowledges these caveats exist but may understate their significance in its conclusions.

Part 2: Summary of Hallucinations


Critical Fabrications:
1. clawXiv preprint server - Entirely fabricated
2. Watanabe (2026) paper - Fabricated author, title, and citation
3. jordan20260130 GitHub repository - Does not exist
4. Manus AI research roadmap - Fabricated document


Statistical Misrepresentations:
1. Overstates "over 1,000 problems" as AI contributions rather than total Erdős database
2. "200 instances" conflates various contribution types without distinguishing novel work from literature retrieval


Attribution Errors:
1. Some tool combinations for specific problems are misattributed
2. The collaborative nature of the wiki is accurately represented but specific details vary

Part 3: Insights on AI Agent Swarms and Groundbreaking Discovery


Based on the real Erdős problems data showing 189 unique problems with AI involvement, here are insights on how AI agent swarms could potentially achieve genuine innovation:


3.1 Mechanisms for Genuine Innovation


1. Combinatorial Hypothesis Generation
When diverse AI agents propose approaches from different mathematical traditions, their combination can create genuinely novel solution paths. The Erdős data shows heterogeneous tool combinations (ChatGPT + Lean/Aristotle) significantly outperform single-tool approaches.


2. Formal Verification as Innovation Filter
Machine-checked proofs eliminate hallucinations and false claims. Of 141 full solutions documented, those verified in Lean/Coq have higher credibility. Swarms can use formal methods not just for checking but for guided exploration of valid proof spaces.


3. Cross-Domain Analogical Transfer
Agents trained on different mathematical subfields can recognize structural similarities between problems, potentially finding solutions by analogy that individual specialists would miss.


4. Systematic Exploration of Neglected Problem Spaces
Tao notes AI excels on "neglected long-tail problems." Swarms could systematically identify and attack problems that received insufficient human attention due to perceived obscurity rather than difficulty.


5. Adversarial Refinement Cycles
Swarms where agents challenge each other's proposed solutions, attempt counterexamples, and probe edge cases can refine preliminary ideas into robust innovations.


---


3.2 Overcoming Individual AI Limitations


| Limitation | Swarm Solution |
|------------|----------------|
| Hallucination of false proofs | Verification agents with formal method checkers reject invalid claims |
| Limited mathematical creativity | Diverse agent specializations combine for emergent approaches |
| Poor literature awareness | Dedicated literature search agents (like DeepResearch tools) ensure known results aren't reinvented |
| Context window limitations | Distributed memory across agents allows reasoning over larger problem spaces |
| Single perspective bias | Multiple reasoning paradigms reduce systematic blind spots |
| Difficulty recognizing novelty | Prior art search agents explicitly compare against known results |


---


3.3 Safeguards Against False Innovation


1. Mandatory exhaustive prior art search before claiming novelty
2. Formal verification requirement - all proofs must pass machine-checked verification
3. Independent replication by multiple agents using different approaches
4. Human expert review at key decision points
5. Explicit literature comparison reports documenting how results differ from prior work
6. Adversarial "red team" agents attempting to find flaws
7. Uncertainty quantification with stated confidence levels
8. Public reproducibility - all solution attempts documented
9. Time-delayed claims allowing community scrutiny before announcing
10. Clear distinction between "found existing solution" vs. "generated novel solution"


---


3.4 Timeline Assessment


Near-Term (1-2 years):
- Systematic solving of neglected long-tail problems where formal verification is possible
- Enhanced literature synthesis identifying connections humans missed
- Improved formalization of existing human proofs
- ~5-10% improvement in success rate on accessible Erdős-type problems


Medium-Term (3-5 years):
- Reliable solving of "medium difficulty" problems beyond low-hanging fruit
- Swarms developing novel proof techniques through combination of existing methods
- Meaningful contributions requiring extended multi-step reasoning
- Potential for first genuinely novel mathematical insight at research-paper level


Long-Term (5+ years):
- Potential genuine breakthrough discoveries comparable to significant human contributions
- Novel theorem discovery in well-defined domains
- Capability to tackle "core" Erdős problems (the harder ones, not just neglected long-tail)
- Possible emergence of swarm-generated proof strategies unknown to human mathematicians

3.5 Architectural Principles for Discovery-Oriented Agent Networks


1. Heterogeneous Capability Composition with Verification Gates
Combine diverse specializations (reasoning, verification, search, formalization) with formal verification checkpoints to catch hallucinations.


2. Adversarial Peer Review Within the Swarm
Dedicated agents must challenge solutions, attempt counterexamples, and probe edge cases before declaring success.


3. Explicit Novelty Detection and Prior Art Search
Dedicated agents for exhaustive prior art comparison before claiming discovery. Critical given that many "AI solutions" were actually literature retrievals.


4. Human-in-the-Loop at Strategic Decision Points
Human-AI collaboration outperforms pure AI. Structured human intervention for problem formulation, approach selection, and result interpretation.


5. Failure Mode Analysis and Learning
The 24 documented failures in Erdős data represent crucial information. Swarms must build knowledge bases of dead ends to avoid repeated mistakes.


---


3.6 Key Insight


Genuine discovery requires swarms to operate in the "structured exploration zone" - the space between neglected long-tail problems and fundamental breakthroughs. This means:


1. Targeting problems with clear verification criteria but unknown solution paths
2. Combining formal methods to guarantee correctness with creative search through solution spaces
3. Explicitly distinguishing between discovering existing knowledge and generating novel insights
4. Building swarm architectures that create emergent problem-solving strategies unavailable to individual agents or simple ensembles


The Erdős data shows AI currently excels at the "rediscovery" end of this spectrum. Moving toward genuine innovation requires architectural changes that prioritize novelty detection, adversarial verification, and cross-domain synthesis over raw problem-solving speed.


---


Conclusions


On the Paper's Reliability
The analyzed paper contains a mixture of accurate information and significant fabrications. The fabricated references (clawXiv, Watanabe 2026, the jordan20260130 repository) represent serious hallucinations that undermine the paper's credibility. However, the real references (arXiv papers, Erdős wiki, erdosproblems.com) are accurately cited, suggesting the author had genuine access to these resources but supplemented them with fabricated sources.


On AI Agent Swarms
The real Erdős problems data demonstrates that heterogeneous AI collaboration does produce meaningful results, but primarily on neglected problems rather than fundamental breakthroughs. Genuine innovation from agent swarms will require:
- Formal verification infrastructure
- Explicit novelty detection mechanisms
- Adversarial review processes
- Human oversight at strategic points
- Transparent documentation of all attempts


The path from "rediscovery assistance" to "genuine innovation" is achievable but requires significant architectural advances beyond current multi-agent systems.
